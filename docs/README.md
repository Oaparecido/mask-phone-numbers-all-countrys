<br>
I want to ask for your help in order to increase this list
<br>
If you want you can help me to increase the list, i would thank you very much for that!

### Rules
**Always follow this code pattern**
* `country_code` - **DDI** from country.
* `country_name` - Country **name** literally.

**Rules mask**
* `+###` - First DDI.
* `####` - For each **'#'** is one number.

```php
    'country_code' => [
        'country' => 'country_name',
        'mask' => '+## ## ####-####'
    ]
```
